Below are the steps:

1. Create a NAT service instance with public network as its right network and a fake network as its left network and auto_policy set to True
2. Create a route-table object.
       route_table = RouteTable("my-route-table")
3. Add a route with prefix=0.0.0.0/0 and next-hop as the service instance name to the route table.
       route = RouteType(prefix="0.0.0.0/0", next_hop="default-domain:default-project:nat-instance1")
       route_table.set_routes(RouteTableType(route))
4. Attach the route table to the network you want to attach to
       vn.set_route_table(route_table)

Note:

1. You can provide any prefix instead of "0.0.0.0/0".
2. You can use the same RouteTable object to connect any number of networks.
