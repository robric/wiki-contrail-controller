*/analytics/send-tracebuffer/<source>/<module>/<instance_id>/<name>*
____
  source - hostname of the server where the contrail module/service runs.
  module - name of the contrail service whose trace-buffer needs to be sent to the Collector.
  instance_id - instance id of the service. 0, if there is only one instance of this service.
  name - name of the trace buffer.

For example, to send a trace buffer named "IFMapTraceBuf" from contrail-control service running in host1

*curl -u <user:password> localhost:8181/analytics/send-tracebuffer/host1/contrail-control/0/IFMapTraceBuf*

After the trace buffer is sent to the Collector, contrail-logs utility can be used to get the trace buffer from the Analytics database.

*contrail-logs --source host1 --module contrail-control --trace IFMapTraceBuf*
