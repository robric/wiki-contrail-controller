vRouter is the component that takes packets from VMs and forwards them to their destinations. In this effort, vRouter depends on the vRouter agent to make sense of the overall topology, understand the various policies that govern the communication between VMs and finally to program them in vRouter in a way vRouter understands. 

vRouter has a few fundamental data structures that abstracts out the various communication paths. So, we have 'interface', 'flow', 'route' and 'nexthop' (all well known terms in networking) that enables vRouter to push packets to their eventual destinations. In addition, vRouter also has a reasonably good statistics support that can help understand and debug packet paths. This guide will detail the various command line utilities provided by the vRouter package that can be used to display all these data structures and make sense of the behavior that one sees in a compute node.
