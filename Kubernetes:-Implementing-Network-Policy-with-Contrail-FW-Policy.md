Contrail FW Security Policy allows decoupling of routing from security policies and provides multi dimension segmentation and policy portability, which significantly enhancing user visibility and analytics functions. 

Contrail FW Security Policy introduces the concept of tags to achieve multi-dimension traffic segnmentation.
Multi dimension segmentation is to segment traffic based on multiple dimensions of entities with security features. Tags are key-value pairs associated with different entities in the deployment. Tags can be predefined or custom defined.

Kubernetes Network Policy is a specification of how groups of kubernetes workloads (i.e. pods) are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. NetworkPolicy resources use labels to select wordloads and define rules which specify what traffic is allowed to the selected workload.
